## Data Types and pass by value and copy address pass by reference
1. Primitive data types: int, double, char, long, short, byte, boolean, float
Java performs a pass by value aka makes copies of the variables of primitive data types
2. Non-primitive data types: String, Array, Object, Class, Interface, Enum, Abstract class
On the other hand Java performs a pass by reference by copying the address of the object's memory location
this way the object is not copied but the address of the object is copied, and the changes are made to
the underlying object.
